# recordatorioSQL

This package is to get my reminders in my virtual assistant. Most of them being birthdays.  
  
I used to do this with **JSON**, but converted it to **SQL** to make it more reliable.


## Usage
  
This is one of my most used functions of my virtual assistant. It runs in a Raspberry Pi, that is not powerfull enough to run Artificial Intelligence models; and Natural Language in Spanish do not work as very well, so I've tryed to make it the most naturallanguajed as possible.  
So you first ask for something by calling:
```python
import recordat

recordat.orio(chat_id = 7654321, vaina = '<<request here>>')
```
The word _Recordatorio_ means _Reminder_, hence the name. 

## Features

- **SQL**: Very fast.
- **Fuzzy Searcher**: Donâ€™t worry about small misspellings.
- **Time Left**: How long until your special date.
- **Spanish Verbs Conjugation Considerer**: Spanish, opposite than English, has many ways of verbs conjugatios. Here we consider that.
- **Week Days**: You can say "_reminder next Thursday this and that_".
