# recordatorioSQL

This package is to get my reminders in my virtual assistant. Most of them being birthdays.  
  
I used to do this with **JSON**, but converted it to **SQL** to make it more reliable.


## Usage
  
Need to fill this later.


## Features

- **SQL**: Very fast.
- **Fuzzy Searcher**: Donâ€™t worry about small misspellings.
- **Time Left**: How long until your special date.
- **Spanish Verbs Conjugation Considerer**: Spanish, opposite than English, has many ways of verbs conjugatios. Here we consider that.
- **Week Days**: You can say "_reminder next Thursday this and that_".
